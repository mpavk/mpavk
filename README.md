<p align="center">
  My journey into software development began with physics‚Äîa discipline that taught me to deconstruct complex phenomena into first principles. I now apply this mindset to engineering, striving to understand how technologies work at a fundamental level rather than just using them as black boxes. This approach enables me to build effective, reliable, and optimized solutions.

### üî¨ My Core Interests & Focus (and Why)

| Domain | My Motivation & Development Goals |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Systems Programming** | üîπ This is the 'physics' of computer systems. I am passionate about exploring how operating systems manage memory, how network protocols function, and how to achieve maximum performance by working close to the metal. **My plan** is to delve deeper into the Linux kernel and develop system utilities in Rust. |
| **High-Performance Backend** | üîπ Here, I see the opportunity to model and build complex distributed systems. I am drawn to the challenge of optimizing databases, developing asynchronous services, and architecting systems capable of scaling under real-world loads. **My plan** is to advance my skills in microservice patterns and orchestration tools like Kubernetes. |
| **Embedded Systems** | üîπ This is the direct bridge between code and the physical world. I'm fascinated by the opportunity to write software for devices that interact with reality through sensors and actuators. **My plan** is to build more projects with ESP32 and Raspberry Pi, focusing on Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) and IoT. |

### üèõÔ∏è My Engineering Principles

* **First-Principles Thinking:** I always strive to understand *how* a technology works internally, not just use it as a 'black box'.
* **Simplicity & Reliability:** The best code is easy to read, maintain, and scale. I prioritize simple and elegant solutions.
* **Performance by Design:** I think about optimization during the architectural phase, not as an afterthought.
